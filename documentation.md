## Decision Process

In the end we decieded to rebuild and improve on the paper **"Gaze Breath: Combining Eye Tracking and Breath Input for Real-time Interaction"**.

### Resons for our decision:

- it seems doable in 2 weeks
- we already have knowledge about the paper
- we already have ideas for improving on the paper
- Andi told us that he found a thermal camera
- we do not have to collect a ton of data!

**For more informations about our decision process please read our documentation [here](https://github.com/ITT-24/assignment-08-replication-muffins/tree/master/docs/decision.md).**
